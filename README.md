# Network-Analysis-to-PPI-Network

CDK4 is an essential protein involved in the cell cycle and is required for the initiation and progres-
sion of various malignancies. Since the growth of tumors is driven by complex proteins networks,
it is essential to integrate biochemistry and mathematics to identify possible avenues to limit pro-
liferation of cancers. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) possesses 23% homologous genes to
humans, and is considered as a useful model for studying gene function. Because of the accessi-
bility of Bakerâ€™s yeast, readily available PPI datasets on yeast, our project focused on applying network analysis on the CDK4 homolog, CDC28 in yeast.
