# Network-Analysis-to-PPI-Network
At a high level, our approach is to use community detection algorithms to uncover the community
structure of the yeast network. Then the central nodes in each of the communities naturally form a
list of potential candidates. Biochemical analysis (mainly literature search) reveals their relevance
to cancer and their suitability for experimentation. BCMB students then used these proteins for
designing experiments to study the target disease. Further, we have performed path analysis between
CDC28 and nodes deemed by BCMB students as important (green nodes). The aim of path analysis
is to identify potential proteins along the path connecting CDC28 and green nodes. These proteins
are generally less central than the green nodes and this makes them suitable targets for knock-down
/ knock out experiments.
